8/28/19 Lab 01- In this lab we created a small network on VShpere which is an online vmware that we will be using in class. When we began the lab we connected to our Wide area network(WAN) and Local area network (LAN) on our fw01 vm. Then after we did that we went into the command line as we did not have our GUI set up yet, which is what we are doing in the command line. We then assigned interfaces in the same order as they were in our VMware configuration. What that looked like was the WAN was associated with the first interface and the LAN is associated with the second interface. Then I had to rename the WAN and LAN to em0 and em1 respectively, and after that I set the interface IP address for the both of them. What I had to do to set up the WAN interface I set the IP addre that was given to me, I put in that it was a 24 bit subnet mask, I set the upstream gateway and used tat for the IPv4 name server as well and as we are not using IPv6 ir DHCP I skipped those parts. Then it asked about HTTP for the GUI and I responded no as we want to use secure https. For the LAN interface I did the exact same steps. After I set both of those up I then powered on wks01 and I had to set my IP address, subnet mask and the default gateway as it was the first time I logged onto that VM. From there I went to the internet and navigated to the fw01's LAN IP address to configure the GUI. What I had to do for that was change the hostname and domain, "uncheck block private networks..." in the RFC1918 part of the configure WAN interface section. Then I set the root password in the system wizard. After I finished the setup I got a screenshot of a successful ping from fw01 to champlain.edu. I then went into the powershell of the wks01 VM to use the commands "whoami", "hostname", "ping -n google.com", and "ipconfig." After that I then went to champlain.edu on google chrome through the wks01 VM. After concluding that I used the command "tracert" to show 3 hops against champlain.edu. Finally I talked about the techincal terms or steps that I was unfamiliar with. Three terms that I was unfamiliar with were, WAN, DHCP and upstream gateway. I found out what WAN was during class as that is when we talked about it and after we talked about it I was not confused about it anymore. The DHCP is something I was also confused about but we did talk about what it stood for and what it did in class so I was able to figure it out fast, what DHCP stands for is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. What DHCP is a network managment protocol. The last term I was confised on was upstream gateway. An upstram gateway defines where traffic exiting that interface should go. I dont remember if we talked about this in class so I searched it up to see what upstream gateways do and what they are used for.
